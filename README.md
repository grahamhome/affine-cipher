# Affine Cipher
This library provides functions for encrypting and decrypting with the affine cipher. It is my solution to the Exercism.org "Affine Cipher" exercise.
## Usage
See tests for usage, use `cargo test` to run tests.
## Concepts reviewed
- `char` to `int` conversion
- `.chunks()`
- Euclidean algorithm
- Extended Euclidean algorithm
